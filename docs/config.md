# Cupdate

## Configuration

Cupdate requires zero configuration, but is very configurable. Configuration is
done using environment variables.

### Persistence

Cupdate stores its state in an SQLite database / file and its cache in a BoltDB
file. Persisting these files is optional, but doing so will ensure that Cupdate
can be started quickly and that the number of outgoing requests are kept to a
minimum, which helps with rate-limited APIs.

The database path is specified using the `CUPDATE_DB_PATH` environment variable,
which defaults to `dbv1.sqlite`. Two additional files are saved alongside the
sqlite file itself: `<sqlite file>-shm` and `<sqlite file>-wal`.

The cache path is specified using the `CUPDATE_CACHE_PATH` environment variable,
which defaults to `cachev1.boltdb`.

### Labels

Cupdate can take additional resource-specific configuration via the use of
labels. For Docker, this means annotating the container image or the container /
service itself. In Kubernetes, any resource in the image's tree can be annotated
to configure Cupdate.

Each label has two aliases to follow both the Docker and Kubernetes conventions.

The web UI can be used to see what labels are used for a given image on the
image's page, in the graph view. Nodes that have labels configured will have an
icon / tooltip indicating that the behavior might differ from the defaults. The
exact labels used can be seen by clicking on a node, which shows a dialog.

#### `ignore`

- Kubernetes: `config.cupdate/ignore`
- Docker: `cupdate.config.ignore`

Set to `true` to ignore the resource subtree (e.g. deployment, pod, or container
). Defaults to `false`.

#### `stay-on-current-major`

- Kubernetes: `config.cupdate/stay-on-current-major`
- Docker: `cupdate.config.stay-on-current-major`

Set to `true` to stay on the current major track specified by images' semantic
tags.

Examples of updates made by Cupdate by default:

- `alpine:3.21.2` -> `alpine:3.21.3` (patch on current major track)
- `node:22.14.0` -> `node:23.8.0` (end of current major track, new major available)

With `stay-on-current-major` set to `true`, Cupdate wouldn't recommend node to
be updated as the newer version is no longer on the same major.

This is useful for databases where updating to a newer major version can take a
lot of time and require changes to applications.

#### `pin`

- Kubernetes: `config.cupdate/pin`
- Docker: `cupdate.config.pin`

Set to `true` to pin images' tags, meaning Cupdate will only recommend updates
to the underlying manifest identified by the tag, as opposed to semantic
updates.

Examples of updates made by Cupdate by default:

- `alpine:3.21.2` -> `alpine:3.21.3` (patch on current major track)
- `node:22.14.0` -> `node:23.8.0` (end of current major track, new major available)

With `pin` set to `true`, neither update would be recommended. However, Cupdate
would still recommend updates like the following, if their tags have been
overwritten, pointing to a newer manifest.

- `latest` -> `latest`
- `alpine:3` -> `alpine:3`

This is useful for databases where updating to a newer version can take a lot of
time and require changes to applications. It is recommended to only use `pin` if
necessary, preferring the use of `stay-on-current-major` alongside a tag that
specifies an as granular version as possible (i.e. `alpine:3.21.2` as opposed to
`alpine:3`). But in cases where the tag is not necessarily semantic, such as
where `12.0.0` -> `12.1.0` would mean a major change, `pin` can be used to force
the tag to not change.

#### Examples

```yaml
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: cupdate
    config.cupdate/ignore: "true"
# ...
```

```yaml
# compose.yaml
services:
  cupdate:
    labels:
      - cupdate.config.ignore: "true"
```

## Custom logos

There is no standard way of attaching a logo to an OCI image. As such, Cupdate
can only automatically identify logos for registries that have a well-defined
way of exposing them. At the time of writing that means only logos found on
Docker Hub are used automatically.

If you want to have logos for other images or override existing logos you can
put them in the directory controlled by the `CUPDATE_LOGOS_PATH` environment
variable (defaults to `logos`). Cupdate will then look for logos that match the
image's name. For example, place a logo for `ghcr.io/alexgustafsson/cupdate` in
the `ghcr.io/alexgustafsson` directory and name the image `cupdate.png`.

Supported extensions:

- `.png`
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.svg`
- `.webp`

Note that the images are cached _even if not found_. That means that when you
add, change or remove a logo, you might have to wait for a few minutes before
the change shows. You can also ask your browser to clean its cache.

## Adding additional trusted certificates

When using Cupdate with self-hosted OCI registries served using TLS, it's
required to configure trust in the certificates in use. This is most commonly
done by trusting the root CA.

Adding a certificate is done by mounting it to the `/etc/ssl/certs` directory
inside of Cupdate's container. The name of the file does not matter. How this is
done differs depending on the platform in use.

Note that the directory contains a default set of certificates in
`ca-certificates.crt`. When mounting additional certificates, it must be done
without affecting this file. In both Docker and Kubernetes, that means mounting
the additional certificates file-by-file to a specific path in the directory as
mounting the whole directory could override the file.
